<p>MY BEST FRIEND IS SONALI Friendship is one of the greatest blessings that not everyone is lucky enough to have.<br>
 We meet a lot of people in the journey of life but there are only a few who leave a mark on us.<br> 
 My best friend is one such person who has been able to make a positive impact on my life.<br>
 We have been a part of each other’s lives for the longest time and our friendship is still developing. <br>
 She has been with me through all the thicks and thins.<br> Most importantly, I feel extremely fortunate to have someone as a best friend in my life.<br>
 In this essay on my best friend, I will tell you about how we became friends and about her best qualities.</p>

 <h2 id="about"style="margin-top:100px;">about my friend</h2>
<h3 style="color:purple;"><p>Our friendship started when my best friend came in as a new admission to our class.<br> 
Both of us were hesitant to talk to each other at first, but gradually we developed a bond.<br>
 I remember the first time my best friend tried to talk to me; I rolled my eyes because I thought there was no use and we wouldn’t hit it off.<br>
 However, to my surprise, we became best friends by the end of the session year.</p></h3>

 <h3 id="about"style="margin-top:100px;">Qualities of my friend</h3>
 <h4 style="color:blue;"><p>my friend is very inteligent.I feel one of the main reasons why I formed such a bond with my best friend was because of the qualities she possesses.<br>
 Her courage always inspired me to raise my voice against injustice as she always stood up to her bullies. <br>
 She is also one of the smartest minds in class who doesn’t only excel academically but also in life.<br>
 I have never seen a dancer as good as my best friend, the accolades she has won are proof of her talent.
Above all, I feel the quality that appeals to me the most is her compassion. Whether it’s towards humans or animals, she always keeps the same approach.<br>
 For instance, there was an injured stray dog that was wailing in pain, my best friend did not only get him treated but she also adopted him.</p></h4>
